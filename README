This is the GNU Mach 1.2 distribution.

This kernel is derived from the Utah kernel source.  We use it to run
the Hurd on.  It is being distributed by us so that we can more easily
modify the source, and so that it will work with the normal GNU coding
standards and Makefile conventions.

libmach, bootloaders, default pagers, and the like are not part of
this distribution.  For libraries, we refer you to the GNU C library,
which has Mach support.  For bootloaders, we refer you to GRUB.  (This
kernel can be loaded by any bootloader that uses the multiboot
standard.)  For default pagers, we refer you to your particular system
that you will run on top of Mach.

The interface generator `MiG' is no longer part of this distribution.

Generic installation instructions may be found in the file INSTALL.

By default, most drivers for network boards are included, as well as
drivers for IDE, SCSI and AHCI disks.

If you want the in-kernel debugger compiled in, specify --enable-kdb
to configure.  This is only useful if you actually anticipate
debugging the kernel, of course.  We don't turn it on be default
because it adds considerably to the unpageable memory footprint of the
kernel.

GNU Mach can be cross-built.  No specific options need to be given when
building on a 32-bit x86 ELF userland such as GNU/Linux.  Manually switch the
compiler to 32-bit mode when using a 64-bit x86 (x86_64) ELF toolchain:

    $ [...]/configure --host=i686-gnu CC='gcc -m32' LD='ld -melf_i386'


Bug reports relating to this distribution should be sent to
bug-hurd@gnu.org.  Requests for assistance should be made on
help-hurd@gnu.org.
